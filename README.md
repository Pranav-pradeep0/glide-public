# Glide - Haptic Video Player

Glide is a React Native video player that blends traditional playback controls with a tactile, subtitle-aware experience. It is built around a custom VLC bridge and adds a smart subtitle pipeline, assisted sync tools, and deep media controls that go beyond a typical player UI.

## Why Glide Feels Different

Most video players focus on decoding and playback controls. Glide keeps that foundation, but then adds a second layer that interprets the video context and makes the experience feel more alive.

This is especially visible in three areas:

- Haptics are driven by subtitle sound effects and synthesized into real vibration waveforms.
- Subtitles are not just rendered, they are parsed, styled, searched, auto-downloaded, and even used for assisted sync.
- Playback controls are gesture-first, with brightness, volume, speed, zoom, and seek all handled directly on the video surface.

## Feature Deep Dive

## 1) Haptic-Enabled Playback

Glide turns SDH subtitle cues into a tactile track.

- Subtitle cues are scanned for bracketed sound effects like [Explosion] or (Footsteps).
- A smart keyword matcher handles variations and blocks false positives with context blacklists.
- ContextAnalyzer uses NLP and sentiment to shape intensity, speed, roughness, and sharpness.
- HapticSynthesizer generates a waveform (not just a single buzz) and the engine applies priority and throttling so it feels intentional, not noisy.
- Intensity is user-tunable and scaled across the entire waveform.

- `C:\glide\src\services\HapticPatternGenerator.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\services\ContextAnalyzer.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\services\HapticSynthesizer.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\services\HapticEngineService.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\hooks\useHapticFeedback.ts`

## 2) Assisted Subtitle Sync (Smart Sync)

Glide includes a floating sync panel with two ways to fix drift:

- Manual adjustment in 50ms steps with immediate feedback.
- Assisted sync that can either search nearby cues by typing what you heard, or auto-listen and transcribe a 10s audio window around the current time.

Auto-listen details:
- FFmpeg extracts a short mono 16kHz WAV clip.
- A quick RMS check skips silent segments to avoid wasted API calls.
- Groq Whisper transcription powers a text query.
- Matches are ranked by proximity and similarity, and then the offset is calculated and applied.

Key files:
- `C:\glide\src\components\FloatingSyncPanel.tsx`
- `C:\glide\src\services\SubtitleSyncService.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\utils\AudioExtractor.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\services\SpeechToTextService.ts`

## 3) Subtitle Engine and Rendering

Subtitles are treated like a full subsystem, not a toggle.

- Embedded tracks are discovered via FFprobe and extracted with FFmpeg when text-based.
- Bitmap subtitles (PGS, VobSub) are detected and rendered natively by VLC.
- External files can be picked locally or downloaded via SubDL.
- SDH content is detected by actual text patterns, not only by filename hints.
- Subtitle rendering supports inline HTML formatting with a custom parser.
- On-screen subtitles are adjustable by pinch (font size) and drag (position) gestures.

Key files:
- `C:\glide\src\services\SubtitleCueStore.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\utils\SubtitleExtractor.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\utils\SubtitleHtmlParser.tsx`
- `C:\glide\src\components\SubtitleOverlay.tsx`
- `C:\glide\src\components\TrackSelector.tsx`
- `C:\glide\src\services\SubtitleSelectionService.ts`

## 4) Visual Enhancement Toggle

A color enhancement toggle is wired directly into the VLC player instance. It allows quick visual boost without leaving playback.

Key files:
- `C:\glide\src\hooks\video-player\usePlayerSettings.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\components\VideoPlayer\AnimatedVideoView.tsx`

## 5) Audio Stack: EQ, Delay, and Route-Aware Volume

Glide has a real audio stack:

- 10-band equalizer with presets and custom tuning.
- Audio delay control with a dedicated sync panel.
- Route-aware volume handling (speaker, wired, bluetooth) with support for >100% boost through VLC when appropriate.
- Hardware volume buttons and gestures update the HUD without fighting each other.

Key files:
- `C:\glide\src\components\EqualizerModal.tsx`
- `C:\glide\src\hooks\video-player\useAudioController.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\hooks\video-player\usePlayerSettings.ts`

## 6) Gesture-First Playback UX

The playback surface acts like a control surface:

- Double-tap seek with ripple feedback.
- Vertical swipes for brightness and volume with HUD indicators.
- Long-press speed boost.
- Pinch and pan zoom with safe constraints.
- Lock mode to prevent accidental touches.

Key files:
- `C:\glide\src\hooks\video-player\usePlayerGestures.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\hooks\video-player\useSeekGesture.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\hooks\video-player\useSpeedGesture.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\components\VideoPlayer\VideoHUD.tsx`

## 7) Resume, Recap, and Context

Glide preserves watch state and adds a recap flow for longer breaks.

- Resume position, selected tracks, and delays are persisted per video.
- A recap modal can generate a short summary based on the last few minutes of subtitle dialogue.
- Content detection helps route movies and series into a details screen.

Key files:
- `C:\glide\src\services\RecapService.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\store\videoHistoryStore.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\services\ContentDetector.ts`

## 8) Library and Metadata

- MMKV-backed indexing for albums and fast search.
- FFprobe-powered metadata badges for bitrate, codec, fps, and subtitle formats.

Key files:
- `C:\glide\src\store\videoIndexStore.ts`
- `C:\glide\src\components\VideoOptionsBottomSheet.tsx`

## Comparison to Typical Players

Compared to mainstream players, Glide focuses less on just playing video and more on extracting meaning and context from it.

- The haptic layer turns SDH subtitles into a tactile track, which most players treat as plain text.
- Assisted subtitle sync uses audio transcription to reduce manual trial-and-error.
- Subtitles are treated as a full pipeline (extraction, formatting, SDH detection, gesture-driven adjustments) rather than a single menu toggle.
- Gesture controls cover not only seeking but brightness, volume, speed, and zoom without interrupting playback.

Glide is not trying to replace any media player. Instead, it is pushing the player experience into a more immersive, assistive, and context-aware space.
